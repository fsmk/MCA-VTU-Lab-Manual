Implement the following using C/C++ Language. 
 
1. Implement Recursive Binary search and Linear search and determine the time required 
to search an element. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number of elements 
in the list to be searched and plot a graph of the time taken versus n. 
 
2. Sort a given set of elements using the Heapsort method and determine the time required to 
sort the elements. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number of elements in 
the list to be sorted and plot a graph of the time taken versus n. 
 
3. Sort a given set of elements using Merge sort method and determine the time required to 
sort the elements. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number of elements in 
the list to be sorted and plot a graph of the time taken versus n. 
 
4. Obtain the Topological ordering of vertices in a given 
igraph. 
 
5. Implement 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming. 
 
6. From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortest paths to other vertices 
using Dijkstra's algorithm. 
 
7. Sort a given set of elements using Quick sort method and determine the time required sort 
the elements. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number of elements in the 
list to be sorted and plot a graph of the time taken versus n. 
 
8. Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given undirected graph using Kruskal's 
algorithm. 
 
9. Print all the nodes reachable from a given starting node in a digraph using BFS method. 
 
10. Check whether a given graph is connected or not using DFS method. 
 
11. Find a subset of a given set S = {sl,s2,.....,sn} of n positive integers whose sum is equal 
to a given positive integer d. For example, if S= {1, 2, 5, 6, 8} and d = 9 there 
are two solutions{1,2,6}and{1,8}.A suitable message is to be displayed if the given 
problem instance doesn't have a solution.
