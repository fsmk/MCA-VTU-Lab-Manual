2. Evaluate a given postfix expression and its values for the variables.

3. Simulate the working of circular queue providing the following operations–Insert, 
    Delete and Display.

4. Demonstrate recursion 
    a. Calculate GCD and LCM of 3 integer numbers 
    b. Solve Towers of Hanoi Problem 
    c. Calculate the sum for a given number ‘n’ from 1 to n. 

5. Simulate the working of a linked list providing the following operations 
    a. Insert at the beginning 
    b. Insert at the end 
    c. Insert before a given element 
    d. Insert at the position 
    e. Display 

6. Simulate the working of a circular linked list providing the following 
operations
